    question: "Can I register just to leave feedback?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. Creating a free community profile unlocks reactions and comments on every project without exposing administrative tools.",
  },
  {
    question: "Where can I manage or cancel the newsletter?",
    answer:
      "Every email contains your personal unsubscribe link pointing to the /unsubscribe hub, which is also linked in the main navigation and footer. Open the link to see your subscribed address, then either confirm the one-click unsubscribe or toggle individual topics and saveâ€”no login required.",
  },
  {
    question: "How quickly will you respond to new contact requests?",
    answer:
      "Messages sent through the contact form land directly in my inbox. I reply within one business day, often much faster.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you send marketing emails after I unsubscribe?",
    answer:
      "No. Once you confirm the unsubscribe action, all promotional communication stops immediately unless you resubscribe manually.",
